## Resume

At the age of 13, I started programming some small applications to understand computers and see what is possible. I have had a huge interest in computers and still have.

Skills I have gained before starting my apprenticeship:
* Web - HTML, CSS, JavaScript
* Java
* C++
* Assembler
* C#.NET

I did my apprenticeship in a logistics company. As a software developer without specification on frontend or backend, I have planned and realized several projects independently. In the meantime I have learned a lot about software architecture, interfaces and data bases. A short list of projects I have done myself and skills I have earned:

* Import logistics data from several countries through different interfaces and store them in a single database automatically.
* Watch and send files and directories automatically over HTTP(S), (S)FTP and SMTP.
* Build up a web interface for employees and customers to share documents referring to specific shipments all over the world (IE6 compatible).
* VB.NET
* C#.NET
* Java
* MSSQL
* Entity Framework
* Team foundation

After my apprenticeship and 1 additional year as a trained developer I started working a small web agency, building web sites for big companies such as Beiersdorf. As a member of a backend team I was switching to frontend after 1 1/2 years. I have learned a lot about working in a timely manner and how to produce highly effective code that is easy to maintain.
