## Resume

At the age of 13, I started programming some small applications to understand computers and see what is possible. I have had a huge interest in computers and still have.

Worth mentioning:
* First web sites using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
* First Java application to read and write files.
* Some years later: Rebuild standard functions from C++ in assembler to find out how the CPU and memory works (for instance: memcpy).

I have made my apprenticeship in a logistics company. As a software developer without specification on frontend or backend, I have planned and realized several projects independently. In the meantime I have learned a lot about software architecture, interfaces and data bases.

* Import logistic data from several countries through different interfaces and store them in a single database automatically.
* Watch and send files and directories automatically over HTTP(S), (S)FTP and SMTP.
* Build up a web interface for employees and customers to share documents referring to specific shipments all over the world (IE6 compatible).

After my apprenticeship and 1 additional year as a trained developer I started working a small web agency, building web sites for big companies such as Beiersdorf. As a member of a backend team I was switching to frontend after 1 1/2 years. I have learned a lot about web development, content management systems, SEO, test-driven development and social media as well as working in a timely manner and producing highly effective code.

* Build up complex web sites in a team using Sitecore (CMS).
* Develop and publish some promotional campaigns.
* Support design agencies, clients and colleagues.
* Maintaining several web sites.
